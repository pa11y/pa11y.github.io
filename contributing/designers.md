# Designers

Hello. Would you like to help us out with brand and design? Pa11y hasn't had loads of attention in this area and we'd love you to join us. It's time to bring some thought and consistency to our project designs :art:

  - [The Pa11y Brand](#the-pa11y-brand)
  - [Design Guidelines](#design-guidelines)
  - [Resources](#resources)


## The Pa11y brand

:construction: TODO introduction to the branding

### Logo usage

This is our standard logo:

![alt text][logo]

This is our small logo:

![alt text][logosml]

When using our logo at sizes of **40px by 40px** and below, you should use the small logo. The small logo has the shadows removed for a clearer display.

When displaying our logo, you may not:

  - alter our logo in any way
  - change the colours in our logo in any way
  - change the orientation of our logo


## Design guidelines
