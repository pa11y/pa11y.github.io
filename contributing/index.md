# Contributing

You've reached the Pa11y contributors guide, thanks for getting involved :tada:

The Pa11y team loves to see new contributors, and we strive to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment. We ask that all contributors read and follow [our code of conduct][code-of-conduct] before joining. If you represent an organisation, then you might find our [guide for companies][companies] helpful. 


## How can I help?

We're glad you asked! There are loads of ways to contribute to Pa11y, you don't have to be a developer to do so either. 

  - ### [Help us to talk to our users][communications]
    This could involve responding to tweets, emails, and feedback. Our documentation and this site can always use some love. We also enjoy it when people write blog posts or speak about Pa11y at conferences.

  - ### [Help us out with design][designers]
    Pa11y started life as a predominantly developer-driven project. We need design and UX people to help us make the whole project more usable. This could involve helping with the brand, the website, and the dashboard.

  - ### [Help us with our code][developers]
    From writing a bug report, to a large refactor, to helping out with a completely new Pa11y project; we always need more developers.

  - ### [Help us with something we haven't thought of!][contact]
    You might be able to help us in a way we haven't thought of, and you should absolutely contact us to tell us that.
