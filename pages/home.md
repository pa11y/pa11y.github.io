# Pa11y

Here at Pa11y, we think making the web more accessible improves it for everyone. So we publish a range of free and open source tools to help designers and developers make their web pages more accessible:

  - ### [Pa11y]
    A command-line interface which loads web pages and highlights any accessibility issues it finds. Useful for when you want to run a one-off test against a web page.

  - ### [Pa11y Dashboard]
    A web dashboard which automatically tests web pages for accessibility issues daily. Graphs help you track improvements and regressions over time. Useful for non-developers to see how your sites perform.

  - ### [Pa11y Webservice]
    The JSON-based webservice that backs Pa11y Dashboard. Useful if you want to build your own dashboard-like front end, or repurpose the data.

  - ### [Pa11y CI]
    A command-line tool which iterates over a list of web pages and highlights accessibility issues. This is a CLI that's more geared towards use in <abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr>.
